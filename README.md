# 1. Gradient Descent:
The starting point is just an arbitrary point for us to evaluate the performance. **From that starting point, we will find the derivative (or slope), and from there, we can use a tangent line to observe the steepness of the slope**. The slope will inform the updates to the parameters—i.e. the weights and bias. The slope at the starting point will be steeper, but as new parameters are generated, the steepness should gradually reduce until it reaches the lowest point on the curve, known as the point of convergence.   

Similar to finding the line of best fit in linear regression, the goal of gradient descent is to minimize the cost function, or the error between predicted and actual y. In order to do this, it requires two data points—a direction and a learning rate.

derivative of a function = slope 

d/dx(square(x)) = 2x
